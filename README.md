# Community Supported Food Forests
Building a new narrative hand in hand with life.

This project aims to use tokenomics to tackle the problem of food insecurity, unemployment and deforestation using food forests. By offering incentives and connecting land owners that want to transform their idle land into food forests with mentors and apprentices willing to work in the establishment of these new food forests.

The context:
Most of the population of Brazil is in the Atlantic Forest region, which has only 5% of its original forest to pasture. Land owners usually lack the financial means to pay for these services, and hence
Prefer to stick to the little but certain money from cattle raising for meat or milk. Rural exodus diminished the rural workforce, but in the 
City a lot of young people are keen to agroforestry and taking courses about it, but dont have money to buy land.

We want to launch a pilot laboratory with a land lease, apprentices and a mentor. The content of these "Food forest lab" would be  shared online in our mirror.xyz page. Each participant will have a wallet and will be part of a local multisig. Landscape changes and trees growth will be tracked on blockchain via NFTs. Participant's will earn NFTs of their digital identities and it will contain a variety of information about their learning level, badges, items (managed species, seeds, attendance, etc). This info will create a reputation system and be offered to be used as commons in a global food forest's economy in a gamified long term coordination with other future pilots.
This grant will be use to pay costs of mentorship, lease and scholarships. The MVP will take place in a rural community in Brazil with villagers enroled in the local agroecology course.
