# Community Supported Food Forests
Building a new narrative hand in hand with life.

This project aims to tackle the problem of food insecurity, deforestation and the loss of ancient knowledge about managing long term agroecosystems, by connecting land owners - that want to transform their old pastures 
Into food forests - with mentors and apprentices willing to work in the establishment of these food forests.

The context:
Most of the population of Brazil is in the Atlantic Forest region, which has only 5% of its original forest to pasture. Land owners usually lack the financial means to pay for these services, and hence
Prefer to stick to the little but certain money from cattle raising for meat or milk. Rural exodus diminished the rural workforce, but in the 
City a lot of young people are keen to agroforestry and taking courses about it, but dont have money to buy land.

Our main goal is to use tokenomics to create incentives and make it easier for people in the city to find nearby landowners and design mentors and access land through land lease contracts in a process of learning while doing it. The content of these "land labs" would
Be then shared online in a platform that would serve as an online meeting space for these 3 different actors. 
Production would  be tracked on blockchain and participant's digital identities would contain a variety of information about their learning level, badges, items (tools, seeds, etc) collected in a gamified long term learning journey.
This grant will be use to pay our content creators as we see them as the first primitive to build a community. As more  contributors come to build the tech side we will be able to budget and apply for more grants.
