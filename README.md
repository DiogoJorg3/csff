# Community Supported Food Forests
Building a neo common global narrative hand in hand with biodiversity.

This project aims to use tokenomics to tackle the problem of food insecurity, unemployment and deforestation using food forests. By offering incentives and connecting land owners that want to transform their idle land into food forests with mentors and apprentices willing to work in the establishment of these new food forests. 

The context:
Most of the population of Brazil is in the Atlantic Forest region, which has only 5% of its original forest to pasture. Rural exodus diminished the rural workforce for agriculture, but in the city a lot of young people are keen to agroforestry and taking courses about it, but dont have money to buy land.

We aim to build a web 3 community to support agroforest enterpreneurs, and want to launch a MVP with a 3 years land lease,a group of apprentices and a mentor. The content of these "Food forest lab" would be shared online seasonally in our mirror.xyz page. Each participant will have a wallet and will be part of a multisig. Landscape changes and trees growth will be tracked on blockchain via NFTs. Participant's will earn NFTs with their digital identities and it will contain a variety of information about their learning level, badges, items (managed species, seeds, attendance for scholarships, etc). This info will create a reputation system and be offered to be used as commons in a global food forest's economy in a gamified long term coordination with other future pilots.
This grant will be use to pay costs of mentorship, lease and scholarships. The MVP will take place in a rural community in Brazil with villagers enroled in the local agroecology course.
